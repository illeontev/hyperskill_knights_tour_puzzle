# knights_tour_puzzle
The game where you should find the way to put the knight on every cell of the chessboard. 
Every cell can be visited only once! 
You can also just watch the solution for this problem if you set board sizes and knight coordinated.

There is no OOP, because this is a task! It would be much more conveninient to use OOP, I agree.
